`ovrstat` is a simple web scraper for the Overwatch stats site that parses and serves the data retrieved as JSON. Included is the go package used to scrape the info for usage in any go binary. This is a single endpoint web-scraping API that takes the full payload of information that we retrieve from Blizzard and passes it through to you in a single response. Things like caching and splitting data across multiple responses could likely improve performance, but in pursuit of keeping things simple, ovrstat does not implement them.

## Getting Started

### Public API Usage

Below is an example of using the REST endpoint (note: CASE matters for the username/tag):
```
https://ovrstat.com/stats/pc/us/Viz-1213
https://ovrstat.com/stats/xbl/Lt%20Evolution
https://ovrstat.com/stats/psn/TayuyaBreast
```

### Installing
To start using ovrstat on your local system, install Go and run `go get`:
```
$ go get s32x.com/ovrstat
```
This will install the ipdata binary on your machine.

### Running with Docker
To start using IPData via Docker, install Docker and run `docker run`:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 s32x/ovrstat
```
This will retrieve the remote DockerHub image and start the service on port 8080.

## Full Go example

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"s32x.com/ovrstat/ovrstat"
)

func main() {
	log.Println(ovrstat.PCStats("Viz-1213"))
	log.Println(ovrstat.ConsoleStats(ovrstat.PlatformXBL, "Lt%20Evolution"))
	log.Println(ovrstat.ConsoleStats(ovrstat.PlatformPSN, "TayuyaBreast"))
}
```
